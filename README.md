My project of a database where 50 000 students are generated with each and everyone have a unique ID, randomized gradeyear, courses and a tuition balance. The program then prints it out into a .txt file
The user can also add its own students to the database. Each and every name that is generated is taken from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dominictarr/random-name/master/first-names.json"
